Improvements:
- Currently we have the dashboards showing data at a per-minute granularity.
  This isn't good for speed, given than we are sending 10,080 entries per page
  view. We could try reducing granularity, adapting it to the dashboard's zoom
  level or think of something else.
- Currently we have a bunch of databases set up. It'd be great to have a single
  source of truth.
